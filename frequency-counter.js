// Given a sentence string, sentence, write a function that returns the most
// common character within the sentence. If there are multiple characters that
// appear the most, return the lexicographically smallest one
// (e.g. if 'a' and 'b' are both the most common, return 'a' because
// it is closest to the beginning of the alphabet). Be sure to exclude spaces when
// counting characters.
const sentence = "What is the most common character in this sentence";

const mostCommonChar = sentence => {
    // Write your solution here.

}

console.log(mostCommonChar(sentence));           //  "t"
