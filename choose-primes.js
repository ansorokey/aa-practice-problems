// Choose Primes
// Write a function choosePrimes(nums) that takes in an array of numbers as args.
// The function should return a new array containing the primes from the original array.
// A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
// Hint: consider creating a helper function to check if a number is prime!

// your code here




console.log(choosePrimes([36, 48, 9, 13, 19])); // [ 13, 19 ]
console.log(choosePrimes([5, 6, 4, 11, 2017])); // [ 5, 11, 2017 ]
