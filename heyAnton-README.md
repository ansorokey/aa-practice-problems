### finally made it to this ###
*firstly*, **thank you** for putting in the work to make this resource, if no one else it is truly appreciated by me and fin.

*secondly*, i am finally ready and able to really collaborate with you on keeping this maintained throughout the weeks ahead of the both of us.
you have already put **SO** many of the problems in here, but i know i can still help, especially knowing that the intensity of our cohorts will be at a constant offset. so i want to really pick it up when you simply don't have the time to.

the only thing holding me back is the way you've structured the files. i love the structure, i just don't know how to add to it and not mess anything up in terms of file order. for instance, when you were creating this, did you make the js files as they came in appAcademy open and somehow rearranged them to be in alphabetical order? or, did you deliberatly go through appAcademy Open, find the first a___ and create the js file.
once i have this cleared up i can get to work helping out.

thanks again man, people like you are going to be successful in whatever they want.
