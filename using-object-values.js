// Write a function that accepts and object, obj,
// and uses Object.values to print all values in the object.

const obj = {
    first: "1",
    second: 2,
    third: "three"
}


const printValues = obj => {
    // Write your solution here.
}

printValues(obj);  // "1", 2, "three" (not apparent in terminal, but the 1 would be a string)
